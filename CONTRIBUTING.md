Contributing document to be written before release to public.  If this is unchanged by release, the following points stand:

 - We welcome contributors, new or veteran.  If you don't understand something, start an issue and we'll help out.
 - Any PR that don't have blaring problems/break other parts of the program that are written will hopefully be fitted into the program.
 - Please use StandardJS for how to layout your code.
 
Thanks for thinking about contributing.
